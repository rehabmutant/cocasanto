#README.md

I really shouldn't be spilling my beans out here in the open but here I go.

This repository is here for me to

A. learn version control system
B. get used to workflows using VCS
C. make the learning experience fun by also learning how to use Ableton Live

SO here I am, trying to learn some coding and DAW.
My career in the manufacturing industry did not require nor appreciate the use of coding in general despite the fact that coding is extremely efficient and useful for any given environment.
I feel it's the most opportune moment for me to study this while everything is under lockdown.

My goal is to

A. be able to use git on a rental server for web development
B. find new opportunities by combining my past experience and coding
C. relieve the stress factor by learning to make music
